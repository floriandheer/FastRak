Android Platform Tools
======================

This folder should contain the Android SDK Platform Tools for ADB sync functionality.

Download from:
https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools

Extract the contents here so that adb.exe is directly in this folder:
  tools/platform-tools/adb.exe
  tools/platform-tools/fastboot.exe
  tools/platform-tools/...

The PowerAmp Sync script will automatically find and use ADB from this location.
