## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`

### Python Dependencies
- `pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing and logo display
- `pyexiv2>=2.8.0` - EXIF metadata handling for images
- `setuptools<81` - Required by invoice2data (Python 3.13+ removed `pkg_resources`)
- `pdfplumber>=0.9.0` - PDF text extraction for invoice processing
- `invoice2data>=0.4.0` - Template-based invoice data extraction
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (included with Python)

### External Software Dependencies

Some pipeline scripts require additional external software:

#### Audio Production Scripts
- **FFmpeg** - Required for audio conversion and format handling
  - Windows: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Linux: `apt-get install ffmpeg` or equivalent

- **FLAC Tools (flac-1.5.0-win or later)** - Required for FLAC metadata operations
  - Used by: Sync iTunes Playlists to DJ Library (for writing playlist metadata to FLAC comment fields)
  - Windows: Download from [xiph.org FLAC downloads](https://xiph.org/flac/download.html)
  - macOS: `brew install flac`
  - Linux: `apt-get install flac` or equivalent
  - Note: The `metaflac` command-line tool must be in your system PATH

#### Cloud Sync Tools
- **rclone** - Required for cloud storage synchronization (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)
  - Used by: Backup MusicBee to OneDrive
  - Download from [rclone.org](https://rclone.org/downloads/)
  - After downloading, extract `rclone.exe` to the `tools/rclone/` folder in this repository
  - Configure your remote: `rclone config` (follow the interactive setup for your cloud provider)
  - Note: The `tools/` folder is gitignored - you must download rclone separately

## Installation

### Prerequisites (one-time, ~2 minutes)

You need **Python** and **git** on the machine before `install.py` can run. Open Command Prompt — press **Start**, type **`cmd`**, press Enter — then:

1. Type **`python`**. Windows opens the Microsoft Store on the Python page; click **Get**.
2. Type **`winget install Git.Git -e`** to install git.
   *If you get "winget is not recognized"*: install **App Installer** from the Microsoft Store first, then retry.
3. Close the window and open a fresh `cmd` so the new tools land on PATH.

Then continue with the one-command install below.

### One command (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floriandheer/FastRak.git
cd FastRak
python install.py
```

`install.py` is a friendly first-run installer that walks you through seven steps:

1. **Prerequisites check** — verifies Python, pip, and git are present (install them via the section above if not)
2. **Python packages** — `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **External tools** — FFmpeg, FLAC, rclone (offers a winget install on Windows)
4. **Environment** — folders, `subst` drive mappings (with registry persistence, no admin needed), Synology checks, pipeline config
5. **Workstation apps** — KeePassXC, Synology Drive, browser, media player, and role-specific picks (Visual / Audio / RealTime / ...)
6. **Desktop shortcut** — generates `Fastrak.lnk` you can pin to the taskbar
7. **Doctor** — verifies the end state is healthy

Every step asks before touching anything. Safe to re-run on the same machine, and gives a clean "all green" report when done.

```bash
python install.py --yes            # accept every prompt (CI / unattended)
python install.py --dry-run        # show what would happen, change nothing
python install.py --step deps      # run a single step
python install.py --skip-externals # skip FFmpeg/FLAC/rclone checks
```

### Manual / piecemeal install

If you'd rather drive it yourself, the building blocks are still available:

```bash
python install_dependencies.py             # just the Python packages
copy setup_config.json.example setup_config.json
# ...edit setup_config.json...
python setup_environment.py                # folders + drives + config
python make_shortcut.py                    # Fastrak.lnk
```

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Usage

### Launching the Pipeline Manager

**Method 1: Python script**
```bash
python fastrak_hub.py
```

**Method 2: Pinned Windows shortcut (recommended)**

A `Fastrak.lnk` shortcut launches the hub through `pythonw.exe` (no console window) and can be pinned to the taskbar/Start menu like a native app. The running window groups under the same taskbar slot as the pinned icon thanks to the `AppUserModelID` set inside `fastrak_hub.py`.

### Creating the Windows Shortcut

#### Option A — Generated (recommended)

Run the helper script from the repo root:

```bash
python make_shortcut.py
```

This produces `Fastrak.lnk` next to the script, with paths resolved relative to wherever the repo is cloned (no hardcoded drive letters). You can also trigger it from Pipeline Manager > Settings > **Create Shortcut**. Then:

1. Right-click `Fastrak.lnk` → **Pin to taskbar** or **Pin to Start**
2. (Optional) Copy the `.lnk` to your Desktop for a desktop icon

#### Option B — Manual setup

If you'd rather configure it by hand (or the helper failed):

1. Right-click on the desktop → **New** → **Shortcut**
2. **Location**: enter the full target with arguments, e.g.
   ```
   "C:\Path\To\Python\pythonw.exe" "C:\Path\To\floriandheer\fastrak_hub.py"
   ```
   - Use `pythonw.exe` (not `python.exe`) so no console window appears
   - Quote both paths if they contain spaces
3. **Name** the shortcut `Fastrak` and finish
4. Right-click the new shortcut → **Properties**
   - **Start in**: set to the repo folder (e.g. `C:\Path\To\floriandheer`)
   - **Change Icon...** → browse to `assets\Favicon_FlorianDheer.ico` in the repo
5. Click **OK**, then right-click → **Pin to taskbar**

The icon and AppUserModelID are already wired up inside `fastrak_hub.py`, so the running window will inherit the icon and merge with the pinned shortcut on the taskbar.

## Configuration

### Customizing Base Paths

Edit the category definitions in `fastrak_hub.py` to customize base folder paths:

```python
CREATIVE_CATEGORIES = {
    "AUDIO": {
        "folder_path": "I:\\Audio",  # Change to your audio base path
        # ...
    },
    # ...
}
```

### Adding Custom Scripts

1. Create your script in the `modules/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `PipelineScript_Category_Name.py`
3. Add the script reference in `fastrak_hub.py` under the appropriate category

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
- Solution: Run `python install_dependencies.py` to install missing dependencies

**Issue: pyexiv2 installation fails**
- Solution: pyexiv2 requires system libraries. On Linux: `sudo apt-get install libexiv2-dev`
- On Windows: Download pre-built wheels from PyPI

**Issue: Scripts don't launch**
- Solution: Verify script paths in the main configuration match your system
- Check that base folder paths exist or script can create them
