"""Tk window z-order helpers.

Currently ships one helper, ``install_keep_on_bottom``, used by
``fastrak_hub`` to pin the launcher window beneath every other
top-level window — clicking it does not bring it to the foreground,
yet keyboard shortcuts and widget click handlers keep working
normally.

No-op on non-Windows platforms; the user request is Windows-specific.

    Whenever the window receives focus — via click, Alt+Tab, or
    anything else that would normally bring it forward — we drop it
    straight back to the bottom with ``SetWindowPos(HWND_BOTTOM,
    SWP_NOACTIVATE)``. Other apps stay visible on top of FastRak;
    clicks on the parts of FastRak that ARE visible still fire
    button handlers, keyboard shortcuts still work.

    Caveat: there is an unavoidable brief flash where Windows
    activates the window before we can react. The flash is short
    (typically < 50 ms) but is not entirely eliminable from
    user-space without sacrificing keyboard focus
    (``WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`` strips that).

    Returns the bound ``to_back`` callable so the caller can also
    schedule it manually (e.g. after a Toplevel dialog closes).
    Returns None on non-Windows platforms.
